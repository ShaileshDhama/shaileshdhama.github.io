abstract: Genome sequencing helps to identify the variation in genomic structure or to detect the new genomic sequences over
the population. This sequence alignment detects the preserved interactome unit among organism. It evaluates the phylogenetic
distance among organism of same species or different species and thereby detecting the functional domains, polymorphisms,
and mutations. Sequence alignment is the arrangement of the sequences of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid
(RNA) or macromolecule to spot regions of similarity which will be a consequence of practical, structural or organic process
relationships between the sequences. In this paper, we detect mutation and the presence of cancer codon using pattern
matching and sequence alignment. The sequences are preprocessed using Boyer Moore and k-mer indexing algorithms.
Mutations present in the sequence is detected with local and global alignment with Naive approximation. Gene sequencing
helps to understand and evaluate the genomic characteristics of an organism at a lesser cost and with great coverage..
